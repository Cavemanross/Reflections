What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	In a folder you can initialize a repsotory with git init.  It will have no commits so it is pretty barren.  You need a file inside the folder to see what it is tracking.  It won't start tracking files until the first commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area is the files added to be applied to the next commit.  Not sure about the value it has to offer in this context.
